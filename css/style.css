Colour Scheme:
Primary Background	#f2bfbf	Use this as the main page background — it's soft and warm, like a cozy blanket.
Header / Navbar	#40648b	Strong and cool — use this for top navigation bar, logo background, or footer to ground the layout.
Accent Sections	#7c5d87	Use for weather cards, sidebars, or alternating section backgrounds. Adds personality without overwhelming.
Highlight / Button	#ff8383	Great for calls to action like buttons ("Refresh", "Get Forecast") or for active states (selected tabs, toggle highlights, etc.)
Secondary Accent	#b88ab2	Use for icon backgrounds, hover states, or subtle borders around cards — ties everything together with a gentle pastel pop.
Text (Main)	#3B3B3B
